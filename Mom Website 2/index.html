          Life coaching is like having a personal trainer for your soul. I help
          people progress further in their life by learning how to discover and
          trust their own inner wisdom and move towards that wisdom.

          sessions, she would ask me about my week and we would easily find
          topics to discuss. The way she breaks down an issue I'm having, so
