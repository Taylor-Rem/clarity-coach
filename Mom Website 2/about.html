            <p class="about-text">
              I grew up the 8th of 9 children watching my older siblings and
              their spouses raise their families. I waited with anticipation for
              when I would be a mom of my own.
            </p>
            <p class="about-text">
              I went to college and got an Early Childhood Education degree
              right before getting married and starting my own family. I taught
              kindergarten for three years before quitting to be a full-time
              mom. I ran a preschool in my home until my third child was born
              and when my sixth and final child went to school, I started
              teaching preschool at a private preschool. I have been there for
              eleven years and counting.
            </p>
            <p class="about-text">
              Through the years, I have seen many different styles of parenting.
              Together, with my husband, we have come up with our own style. We
              have observed and experienced success and failures along the way
              and have come to believe that success isn’t tied to achievements,
              but to relationships.
            </p>
            <p class="about-text">
              It was a long journey for me to see that a loving relationship was
              more important than anything else. I wanted to control my children
              thinking in the long run this would serve them well, but it wasn’t
              what was best. It wore me out completely until I was depressed and
              dealing with health challenges.
            </p>
            <p class="about-text">
              Hitting rock bottom was the catalyst that helped me reach out for
              help. For the first time in my life I invested in myself and began
              therapy, yoga, mindfulness meditation, and eventually training to
              be a life coach.
            </p>
            <p class="about-text">
              I learned that for me, depression symptoms were from being out of
              balance with my life and not listening to my inner wisdom. I now
              understand that the most important relationship is the one with
              yourself. When that relationship is healthy and stable, the
              groundwork is set for other relationships to flourish.
            </p>
            <p class="about-text">
              Through therapy and coaching, I was able to detach from my old
              story and create a new one with a fresh perspective. This allowed
              me to get past being a victim, forgive my loved ones who were
              doing their best, and to see I need compassion and love for
              myself. Investing in myself helps me have clarity and gives me the
              strength to make healthy changes.
